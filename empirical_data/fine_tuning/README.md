# Introduction
Each folder contains one data within two districts. The folder_name is the critical value of average tree coverage and annual rainfall. 
Files in each folder contains:
+ `x.npy` - Time series of average tree coverage.
+ `cont_para.npy` - Time series of annual rainfall (control parameter).
+ `trend.pdf` - Figure of the average tree cover versus the annual rainfall.
