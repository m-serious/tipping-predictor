# Introduction
Each folder contains one subset of data within a new district. The folder_name is the critical value of average tree coverage and annual rainfall. 
Files in each folder contains:
+ `x.npy` - Time series of the tree coverage before critical transition.
+ `cont_para.npy` - Time series of the annual rainfall (control parameter) before critical transition.
+ `x_avg_long.npy` - Time series of the average tree coverage.
+ `cont_para_long.npy` - Time series of the annual rainfall (control parameter).
+ `trend.pdf` - Figure of the average tree cover versus the annual rainfall.
